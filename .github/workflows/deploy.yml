Thought for 1 second### Complete Guide: From Deployed Website to Local Development

I'll walk you through the entire process of getting your website from the deployed version to a local development environment where you can make changes in your code editor.

## Part 1: Download Your Code

First, you need to get the code from the deployed website:

1. **Download the code**:

1. Look for the "Download" or "Export" button in the v0 interface
2. This should download a ZIP file containing all your website code



2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder on your computer:

1. Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All..." (Windows) or double-click (Mac)
2. Choose a location you can easily find, like your Documents folder
3. Name the folder something like "personal-website"





## Part 2: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new GitHub account** if you don't have one:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign up



2. **Create a new repository**:

1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it "personal-website" (or whatever you prefer)
4. Add a description like "My personal portfolio website"
5. Keep it "Public"
6. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"





## Part 3: Set Up Git on Your Computer

1. **Install Git** if you haven't already:

1. Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Mac: Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install git` or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
3. Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install git`



2. **Configure Git** (one-time setup):

```shellscript
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```




## Part 4: Install Node.js and npm

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:

1. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. Follow the installation instructions for your OS



2. **Verify installation**:

```shellscript
node --version
npm --version
```

Both commands should display version numbers if installed correctly




## Part 5: Connect Your Local Code to GitHub

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**:

1. Windows: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
2. Mac: Open Terminal from Applications > Utilities



2. **Navigate to your project folder**:

```shellscript
cd path/to/your/personal-website
```

Replace "path/to/your" with the actual path where you extracted the ZIP file


3. **Initialize Git repository**:

```shellscript
git init
```


4. **Add your files to Git**:

```shellscript
git add .
```


5. **Commit your files**:

```shellscript
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```


6. **Connect to your GitHub repository**:

```shellscript
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/personal-website.git
```

Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username


7. **Push your code to GitHub**:

```shellscript
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```




## Part 6: Set Up Local Development Environment

1. **Install project dependencies**:

```shellscript
npm install
```

This might take a few minutes as it downloads all necessary packages


2. **Start the development server**:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```


3. **View your website locally**:

1. Open a web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see your website running locally!





## Part 7: Set Up a Code Editor

1. **Install Visual Studio Code** (recommended for beginners):

1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Follow the installation instructions



2. **Open your project in VS Code**:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to File > Open Folder
3. Navigate to and select your "personal-website" folder



3. **Install helpful extensions** (optional but recommended):

1. Click the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Search for and install:

1. "ESLint" for code quality
2. "Prettier" for code formatting
3. "JavaScript and TypeScript" for language support
4. "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" for Tailwind CSS help








## Part 8: Making Changes to Your Website

1. **Edit files in VS Code**:

1. Navigate the folder structure in the left sidebar
2. Click on files to open and edit them
3. Common files you might want to edit:

1. `app/page.tsx` (homepage)
2. `app/projects/page.tsx` (projects page)
3. `app/resume/page.tsx` (resume page)
4. `app/contact/page.tsx` (contact page)
5. `app/globals.css` (global styles)






2. **See changes in real-time**:

1. With the development server running (`npm run dev`), changes will automatically appear in your browser
2. Just save the file and switch to your browser to see the updates



3. **Commit and push your changes**:

```shellscript
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```




## Part 9: Deploying Your Updated Website

1. **Configure Next.js for static export**:

1. Create or edit `next.config.mjs` in your project root:


```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // If you're not using a custom domain, uncomment and update:
  // basePath: '/personal-website',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```


2. **Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment**:

1. Create folder structure: `.github/workflows`
2. Create file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. Add this content:


```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: out
          branch: gh-pages
